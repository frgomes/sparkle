js
. finish require.js modularization
. verify basic firefox and safari support
. hover to get point info (use voronoi to select)
. build: bundle/optimize .js files into sg.min.js (usable w/o require.js)
. build: run jslint
. separate js from server git repo via git subtree?
. highlight time-band and get summary of just that region (e.g. area under the curve)
. grouped bar chart
. more chart types: scatter, area, heatmap, stacked bar chart
. support multiple X axes (to compare two data sets from different time)
. interactive offset of X axis (to align second data set when comparing)
. grid lines, see e.g. http://www.d3noob.org/2013/01/adding-grid-lines-to-d3js-graph.html
. improve default styling
. icon for resize hitbox ('grippy corner')
. keyboard navigation, up to zoom out, left to pan left, right to pan right, down to zoom in
. scroll-wheel navigation for zooming
. button to pop out graph into new window and resize with the window (make it easy to go full screen on a graph in presentations)

data server
. send hover highlight info down along with data (or separate feed?)
. progress indicator when large data sets are being loaded
. REST endpoint for summary region UI
. simple subcription/notification api so web page can refresh when data changes
. stream data from stdin pipe (cat file | awk | sg)
. stream data to javascript (optimization instead of refreshing the whole graph)
. publish sg script (that uses pre-built binary)

-- done --
* transitions for x and y axes
* max-lock mode for y axes
* --root option on the command line, to display app specific dashboards
* move main.js into data server singlechart template
* load directory and watch for changes
* document component model
* picker to choose which series to display
* expose line smoothing options
* more internal documentation (esp. bound data structures)
* event timeline plot
* revise documentation for component model
. revise lock mode to lock on current value, not just series max (user can always zoom out)
* handle file not found on /data request by returning a 404 
* enable easily extending the REST api w/o building your own main server
* get rid of serverDescribedGraph
* data missing messages should spread out, not overlap each other
* legend should go in an overlay
* categorized plots: time axis should have a line along the top of the axis (with no y axes, the sides of the plot are hard to recognize) 
* add some extra space within the clip region to fit in scatter plot marks that extend past the sides
* time series bar graph
* more default color palettes
* dashboard zoom all mode
* make history work on dashboards too
* bump to current rev of d3
* add first unit/integration tests 
* rework zoom transition - generate transition from chart, not internally in the zoom component
* add basic unit test for chart
* add local api to serve data from javascript array 
* start on cassandra backend
. bump to sbt 13
. support alternate data backends (set in application.conf like .api)
. try adding spire or saddle 
. api for quick graphs from the REPL (import SG._;  plot(myList); plot(myList, myDashboard) )
. abstract X axis numeric type (currently hardcoded to date time)
