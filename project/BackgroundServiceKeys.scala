/** The background service provides a set of keys for launching a project in a background jvm,
 *  and launching related services as well. 
 *  
 *  Projects using the BackgroundService should add BackgroundService.settings to their build settings. 
 *  e.g.
 *        .settings(BackgroundService.settings: _*)
 *  
 *  Projects can set dependencies on other projects that need to be running:
 *          dependenciesToStart := Seq(kafkaServer, cassandraServer),
 *         
 *  Projects should provide a function to check their liveness (e.g. by making a protocol request
 *  to verify the server), and typically set a main class:
 *       .settings(BuildSettings.setMainClass("com.nestlabs.kafka.Main"): _*)
 *          healthCheckFn <<= HealthChecks.kafkaIsHealthy,
 *          
 *  Projects wishing to override the it:test command to start dependent services, use: 
 *         test in IntegrationTest := BackgroundService.itTestTask.value
 *  (someday this may become automatic)
 *  
 *  A set of tasks useful from the sbt command line are also avaiable. 
 * 
 *    
 *  BackgroundService depends on the revolver plugin.
